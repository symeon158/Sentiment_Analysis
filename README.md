## Introduction

Sentiment analysis, a pivotal aspect of text analysis, facilitates the deciphering of emotions, attitudes, and opinions embedded in textual data. Applied across diverse domains like marketing and politics, this project specifically delves into analyzing sentiments towards data analysis tools: Python, Power BI, and Excel, encapsulated in a collection of tweets.

## Data Collection

Utilizing the Twitter API, tweets pertinent to the data analysis tools of interest were amassed, forming the foundational dataset for our sentiment analysis journey.

## Data Cleaning

Engaged in a meticulous data cleaning process, employing Regular Expressions to purify the tweets by:
- Eradicating URLs
- Omitting mentions and retweets
- Removing irrelevant or duplicate entries

## Sentiment Analysis

Leveraged the TextBlob library, a simplistic API for natural language processing in Python, to perform sentiment analysis on the cleaned data. The sentiments were categorized as:
- Positive
- Negative
- Neutral

## Data Storage

Enacted procedures for systematically storing the analyzed data into a database, ensuring optimal organization and retrieval functionality for future analysis and visualization.

## Data Visualization

Utilized data visualization libraries, Matplotlib and Seaborn, to create:
- Bar charts reflecting sentiment distributions
- Time-series plots elucidating sentiment evolution over time and across different categories.

## Conclusions
